Air Monitoring Reference Database — Excel Template
""
PURPOSE
This workbook is the authoring environment and source of truth for the air monitoring
reference database. Each tab represents one table. Data validation dropdowns on foreign
key columns enforce referential integrity during data entry.

TAB OVERVIEW
"  Chemicals          — Core chemical records (anchor table, populate first)"
  Devices            — Physical instruments only
"  Sensors            — Detection elements (PID, EC, FID, NDIR, etc.)"
  Sampling_Methods   — NIOSH/OSHA/EPA collection methods
"  Documents          — Reference materials (SDSs, ERGs, tech bulletins)"
  Device_Sensor      — Junction: which sensors fit in which devices
"  Sensor_Chemical    — Junction: intended detection (correction factors, ranges)"
  Sensor_CrossSens   — Junction: unintended interference data
  Chemical_Method    — Junction: which methods apply to which chemicals
  Chemical_Document  — Junction: which documents relate to which chemicals

KEY STRATEGY
All tables use human-readable natural keys:
"  Chemicals:   CAS number (e.g., 7783-06-4)"
"  Devices:     MFG-MODEL slug (e.g., RAE-MULTIRAE-LITE)"
"  Sensors:     MFG-TARGET-TECH slug (e.g., RAE-PID-10.6EV)"
"  Methods:     AGENCY-NUMBER (e.g., NIOSH-6013)"
"  Documents:   TYPE-SUBJECT slug (e.g., SDS-H2S-AIRGAS)"

COLOR CODING
  Blue bold text     = Primary key (unique identifier for this record)
  Orange text        = Foreign key (must match a PK in another table)
  Dropdown columns   = Foreign keys with data validation from parent table
""
DATA ENTRY WORKFLOW
1. Populate Chemicals first (everything references this table)
2. Work device-by-device: add Device → add its Sensors → link in Device_Sensor
"3. For each sensor: add Sensor_Chemical rows, then Sensor_CrossSens rows"
4. Add Sampling_Methods and link via Chemical_Method
5. Add Documents and link via Chemical_Document
""
SLUG CONVENTIONS
  - ALL CAPS with hyphens as separators
"  - No spaces, no special characters"
"  - Device: MANUFACTURER-MODEL  (e.g., TSI-DUSTTRAK-8530)"
"  - Sensor: MANUFACTURER-TARGET-TECHNOLOGY  (e.g., CITY-CO-EC)"
  - Keep them short but unambiguous
""
NOTES
  - Dropdown lists auto-populate from the PK columns of parent tables
"  - If you add a new chemical/device/sensor, it becomes available in dropdowns"
  - Pre-formatted for 200 data rows per tab; extend as needed
  - Python upload notebook will validate all FKs before publishing to AGOL
